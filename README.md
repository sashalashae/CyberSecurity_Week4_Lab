## Notes
   I have been stuck on Challenge 3 for three days.  I have been unsuccessful at completing the challenge.  I looked at the hint and when I look at the cookie values before and after the change.  They remain the same and do not change.  The only change I see is the userPassWord to newPassword.  I tried manipulating those values, but still no success.
